                I always wanted the "About" section to be the last item in the Tab contents. Why, you ask? Because all the sections before it display my work, skills, and projects well enough for you to decide if I'm a good fit for a role. (There's more than a 90% chance you're here because of that) But how do you evaluate a person in the early stages, especially over the internet? The short answer is, you can't! However, I can share something about myself and be quite honest while doing so.

                It all began during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was at home, watching random YouTube videos. No school, no meeting up with friends, just me at home, passing the time with some interesting videos. Eventually, I came across a programming video that caught my attention. It was about Python programming. This led me to learn the basics of programming and sparked a high curiosity about how computers and smartphones work. I entered a phase where I watched videos explaining basic computer science concepts. Soon, I stumbled upon some hacking tutorials. I was really excited about it! The next few months were spent trying to learn everything needed to start learning hacking. The first step was to understand the basics of how computers and networking work.

                Many people recommended Professor Messer’s CompTIA Playlist. I completed both playlists and then started experimenting with Linux. I downloaded VirtualBox, installed Kali Linux, and tried fixing various errors by searching online. I worked with the terminal, tried memorizing commands, switched between different Linux distributions (distro hopping), and tried to build my perfect Linux OS by adjusting many settings and the user interface. I did a lot of other crazy stuff. Finally, I started learning about cybersecurity from The Cyber Mentor. Started of with a free course and then began learning from a popular site called TryHackMe. Eventually, I found myself unable to understand what was happening. I was just following tutorials, and every time I tried to solve a CTF (a game where you hack into a vulnerable machine), I couldn't do it without some help. Out of frustration, I dropped everything and even deleted my TryHackMe account. It was nothing like the movies; it required a much deeper understanding of many topics. My desire to become a cybersecurity expert was put on hold.

                Eventually, after completing my 12th grade, I started with DSA. It was a very popular topic at the time. I began learning and solving problems from Striver’s A2Z DSA sheet (one of the best explanations ever!). After a few months, I got pretty bored and wanted to actually build something, like an app or a product. The timing was perfect because Harkirat Singh, well-known for Web Dev and Web3 stuff, had just announced his new cohort launch. I bought it, making it one of my first course purchases. I followed it closely, and after a while, I was on my own. I could now build things I once only imagined. I continue to explore and try to build new projects. I've come a long way, even getting my first freelance gig. Now, here I am, patiently waiting for my next opportunity and learning about various other things.
